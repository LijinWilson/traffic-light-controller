## Traffic Light Controller
This repository showcases the design and implementation of a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog. The project simulates a real-world traffic management system, ensuring smooth vehicle movement at intersections through an efficient state-based control mechanism.

- Key Features:
- State Machine Design:
    Implements a finite state machine (FSM) to manage traffic light transitions.
    Includes states for Red, Yellow, and Green lights with precise timing.
- Simulation:
    Functional and timing simulation performed using Xilinx Vivado or equivalent tools.
    Verified output waveforms for light transitions.
- Parameters:
    Configurable timing for each light state.
    Priority handling for emergency or pedestrian signals.
- Fault Tolerance:
    Built-in error detection for unexpected states.
- Tools Used:
    Verilog for RTL design.
    Xilinx Vivado/NCSim for synthesis and simulation.
- Applications:
    Traffic management systems for intersections.
    Can be extended for multi-junction or adaptive traffic systems.
